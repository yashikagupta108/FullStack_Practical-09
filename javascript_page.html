        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, 
        many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose 
        implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming 
        language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, 
        possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995
